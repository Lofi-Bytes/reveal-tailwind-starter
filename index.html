                  <p class="text-xl mt-10 tracking-wider">Enzo knows he is different from other dogs: a philosopher with a nearly human soul (and an obsession with opposable thumbs), he has educated himself by watching television extensively, and by listening very closely to the words of his master, Denny Swift, an up-and-coming race car driver.</p>

              <p class="mt-6 text-3xl tracking-wider text-left leading-tight">Summary</p>

              <p class="tracking-wider text-lg text-left mt-3 w-7/12">The narrator, a dog named Enzo, begins the story with a discussion of how he must communicate through gestures, since he's not able to form language with his long tongue. This need to rely on gestures is why he's currently lying on the floor in a puddle of urine, waiting for Denny (his owner) to come home and find him.</p>

              <p class="tracking-wider text-lg text-left mt-3 w-7/12">Enzo is old, but he says he doesn't really want to get any older. He believes that Denny would do whatever it took to keep Enzo alive, but Enzo doesn't want to be kept alive. Enzo says this is because of the second-best thing he ever saw on televisionâ€”a documentary on Mongolia, which said that when a dog is finished being a dog, he will be reincarnated as a man. The best thing Enzo ever saw on television, he says, was the 1993 Grand Prix of Europe, in which Ayrton Senna drove like a genius in the rain.</p>

              <p class="mt-6 text-3xl tracking-wider text-left leading-tight">Analysis</p>

              <p class="tracking-wider text-lg text-left mt-3 w-96">Notice Enzo's insistent focus on storytelling and acting. He's acting to communicate and tell a story for Denny, and he's able to piece together the story of Denny's day by picking out the different smells on him. However, we see how old and ill Enzo really is, as it becomes obvious that Enzo's act isn't really that far away from the truth. Enzo's quips about humanlike willpower and "emoting" set up a hierarchy, with humans and humanlike qualities above canine qualities like "emoting."</p>
